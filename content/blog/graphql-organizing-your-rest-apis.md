PROBLEM

Let's suppose we have a super complicated application that displays a list of missions' cards showing up the villain and also the heroes that saved the day. It looks like this one:

![Missions application](/assets/screen-shot-2020-06-25-at-6.33.27-pm.png "Missions application")

How would we build an application like this one backed by REST apis?

Let's suppose we have the following REST api schema:

![Rest API](/assets/rest.png "Rest API")
