Hi, my name is Alex Andrade!

I am currently living in Saskatoon, Canada, the land of living skies where I came here from Brazil to embrace new challenges at 7shifts. Here, every single day, we build something great to empower restaurants with amazing solutions, so they can focus their time on their business. 

If you are passionate about solving hard problems, this might bee a good place for you.

Even though I am a full stack developer, I  L O V E  front end. It is amazing how React hooks has changed how we share behaviour between our application keeping our code clean and readable, if well implemented, of course. The goal of this blog is to share small tips, gotchas, and code examples on how to solve common problems that you might face and how we can leverage our code quality and performance.

I DO CARE A LOT ABOUT TESTS! It is all about getting confidence from your code. It is really simple write test and achieve near 100% code coverage, but is it really giving you confidence? For a long time I was writing tests the wrong way, testing implementation details instead of how the user of my code would interact with the component/hook/piece of code I was building. Since I learned about React Testing Library, my mind opened for a new world.

During my spare time I love spending time outside with my wife and two daughters. On the summer we use to go camping, explore new places and breath fresh air. Believe me, spend time with your loved ones, you can have the most successful career in the world but, if you have a failed family, that does not worth it.

Before I came here I worked for 4 years at TOTVS, the largest technology company in Latin America. There, I learnt in practice how it is like to maintain a H U G E software used for large customers, going out of just software development and in fact iteracting with customers and learning with them (it makes total difference).
