  It seems 2020 was the year where everything stopped but, looking back after 9
  months of pandemy we can see that we actually grew much more than we thought.

How to grow in a year we see everything stopping for the first time in history? In this blog post, I will share what I learned and what has been working for me.

This is not going to be a technical blog post, but instead, I thoght 2020 deserves a special place here in the blog. 

What a year!

For those not aware (maybe living on another planet or reading this 20 years later), this year the humanity was hit hard by a global pandemic caused by the CORONA virus. Since the pandemic has been declared more than 1.79 million people died worldwide at the moment I am writing this (Dec 29th, 2020).

As a result, everyone got scared (no one wants to die) and hard were the measures to hold the virus spread:

* We started using masks
* No more hugs and high-fives
* Schools closed so, kids had to stay at home
* Working from home was the new norm now
* Restaurants had to reinvent themselves to keep serving
* A lot of people lost their jobs and had to rely on support programs
* And much more...

Undoubtedly it was the hardest year ever but, this reminds me of this iconic quote: 

> We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
